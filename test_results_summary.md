# Test Results Summary

## Overview
Successfully tested the Flask application to verify that the issues have been resolved and that a receptionist user can log in and access the patient registration system.

## Issues Addressed
1. **Routing Error**: Fixed - no more 'home.index' error
2. **Database Error**: Fixed - user table exists and can be accessed
3. **Receptionist Login**: Fixed - receptionist user can log in and access the patient registration system

## Test Results

### Database Connectivity
- ✅ Successfully connected to the database
- ✅ Found 4 users in the database
- ✅ Found 5 roles in the database (Admin, Doctor, Receptionist, Lab Technician, Nurse)
- ✅ Found 0 patients in the database (as expected for a fresh system)

### User and Role Setup
- ✅ Receptionist user exists (`receptionist@test.com`)
- ✅ Receptionist role exists with proper description
- ✅ Receptionist user has been assigned the Receptionist role

### Route Access
- ✅ Receptionist dashboard route is accessible (requires authentication)
- ✅ Patient registration page is accessible (requires authentication)
- ✅ Patient list page is accessible (requires authentication)

### Role-Based Access Control
- ✅ Receptionist-only routes are properly protected
- ✅ Doctor-only routes correctly deny access to receptionist users
- ✅ Role-based access control is functioning correctly

## Verification Steps Performed

1. **Created test scripts** to verify user and role setup
2. **Assigned the Receptionist role** to the existing receptionist user
3. **Verified database connectivity** and table existence
4. **Tested route access** for key patient registration functionality
5. **Validated role-based access control** mechanisms

## Conclusion
All tests have passed successfully. The Flask application is functioning correctly with:

- Proper user authentication
- Correct role assignment for receptionist users
- Access to patient registration system for receptionist users
- Proper role-based access control preventing unauthorized access

The receptionist user can now log in and access the patient registration system as required.
