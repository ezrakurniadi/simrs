### Sprint 1 Total: 26 story points

## Sprint 2: Clinical Safety Enhancements (Medium Priority)

### Goal
Enhance clinical safety features to improve patient care and safety protocols.

### Stories
1. **Story 1**: As a clinician, I want to record specific patient allergies so that I can avoid prescribing medications that could cause adverse reactions.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create separate Allergy model with specific types
     - Add relationship between Patient and Allergy models
     - Create AllergyForm for detailed allergy recording
     - Update templates to display detailed allergy information
   - **Estimated Effort**: 8 story points

2. **Story 2**: As an infection control specialist, I want to track infectious disease status and isolation precautions so that we can prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Add isolation_precaution_type field to Patient model
     - Add infectious_disease_status field to Patient model
     - Add corresponding fields to forms and templates

     - Add physiological_state field to Patient model
     - Add implanted_devices field to Patient model
     - Add corresponding fields to forms and templates
   - **Estimated Effort**: 5 story points

### Sprint 2 Total: 18 story points

## Sprint 3: Operational Enhancements (Low Priority)

### Goal
Improve operational efficiency through enhanced patient information tracking.

   - **Tasks**:
     - Add middle_name field to Patient model
     - Add suffix field to Patient model
     - Add corresponding fields to forms and templates
   - **Estimated Effort**: 3 story points

2. **Story 2**: As a registration clerk, I want to collect detailed contact information so that we can effectively communicate with patients.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Add home_phone, work_phone, mobile_phone fields to Patient model
     - Add mailing_address field to Patient model
     - Add corresponding fields to forms and templates
   - **Estimated Effort**: 5 story points

3. **Story 3**: As a care coordinator, I want to track Primary Care Physician and Referring Physician information so that we can maintain continuity of care.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Add primary_care_physician field to Patient model
     - Add referring_physician field to Patient model
     - Add corresponding fields to forms and templates
   - **Estimated Effort**: 3 story points

4. **Story 4**: As a communication coordinator, I want to track detailed communication preferences so that we can contact patients according to their preferences.
   - **Tasks**:

     - Add frequent_no_show flag to Patient model
     - Add corresponding fields to forms and templates
   - **Estimated Effort**: 5 story points

### Sprint 3 Total: 19 story points

## Overall Implementation Timeline

With a team velocity of approximately 20-25 story points per sprint, the implementation would take approximately 3 sprints or 6-9 weeks to complete all enhancements:

- **Sprint 1**: Weeks 1-3 (Regulatory/Compliance)
- **Sprint 2**: Weeks 4-6 (Clinical Safety)
- **Sprint 3**: Weeks 7-9 (Operational Enhancements)

## Risk Assessment

1. **Data Migration**: Adding new fields to the Patient model may require database migrations
2. **Integration**: New fields may need to be integrated with existing reporting systems
3. **Training**: Staff will need training on new fields and their importance
4. **Validation**: Proper validation will be needed for new data fields to maintain data quality

## Success Metrics

1. **Compliance**: System meets all regulatory requirements for patient data collection
2. **Data Quality**: 95% completeness of new data fields within 30 days of implementation
3. **User Satisfaction**: 90% of staff report that the new fields improve their workflow
4. **Patient Safety**: Reduction in adverse events related to missing patient information
