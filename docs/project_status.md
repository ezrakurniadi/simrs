# Patient Registration Form Implementation Status

## Project Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the patient registration form enhancement project. The changes were implemented to align the form more closely with the guidelines specified in [docs/patient_registration.md](patient_registration.md) and to improve the user experience.

## Implementation Status
### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Analyzed the current patient registration form implementation
2. ✅ Identified gaps between current implementation and guidelines
3. ✅ Planned improvements for the patient registration form
4. ✅ Updated the patient form class to include all required fields
5. ✅ Updated the patient model to support new fields
6. ✅ Updated the patient routes to handle new fields
7. ✅ Created a comprehensive test plan for the updated form
8. ✅ Created documentation for all changes made

### In Progress
1. ⏳ Update the patient registration template to improve UI/UX
   - The template implementation plan has been created
   - The actual template file still needs to be updated with the new fields and dynamic behavior

### Remaining Tasks
1. 🔧 Implement the template changes by updating `app/templates/patients/new.html` with the code specified in the implementation plan
2. 🧪 Test the updated patient registration form in the browser to ensure all fields are displayed correctly
3. 🧪 Test the dynamic field behavior to ensure fields appear and disappear as expected
4. 🧪 Test form submission to ensure all data is properly stored in the database

## Implementation Summary
The patient registration form has been enhanced with additional fields to align with the guidelines specified in [docs/patient_registration.md](patient_registration.md). The implementation includes:

- New fields in the form class and model for capturing additional patient information
- Dynamic fields that appear only when relevant (based on boolean field values)
- Updated routes to handle the new fields properly
- Comprehensive documentation of all changes made

The only remaining step is to implement the template changes, which requires switching to Code mode to modify the actual HTML template file.
