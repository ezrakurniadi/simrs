### 4. Route Updates
- Updated patient registration route in `app/patients/routes.py` to handle new fields
- Updated patient edit route in `app/patients/routes.py` to handle new fields
- Added proper conditional logic to store dynamic field data only when their corresponding boolean fields are True
- Implemented MRN auto-generation during patient registration
- Added handling for new consent and privacy fields

### 5. Database Migrations

- Documented test cases for form creation, validation, submission, rendering, database integration, and edge cases
- Added test cases for new functionality including MRN generation, race/ethnicity fields, insurance information, and consent tracking

## Implementation Details

### Medical Record Number (MRN) Implementation
- Implemented auto-generation of unique MRN values in the format "00-00-00-00"
- MRN is generated during patient registration and stored in the database
- MRN follows a sequential pattern with proper incrementation and carry-over handling
- MRN is displayed as a readonly field in the registration form

### Race and Ethnicity Fields Implementation
- Added Race and Ethnicity fields to support public health reporting requirements
- Implemented as select fields with predefined options for standardized data collection
- Fields are stored in the patient model for future reporting and analytics

### Enhanced Insurance Information Collection
- Added comprehensive insurance information fields:
  - Insurance policy/ID number for identification
  - Insurance group number for group coverage
  - Guarantor information including name, relationship, phone, and address
- All fields are properly validated and stored in the database
- Information is displayed in both registration and patient view templates

### Consent and Privacy Practice Tracking
- Added fields to track patient consent for medical treatment
- Added fields to track patient acknowledgment of privacy practices
- Implemented as boolean fields with proper validation
- Information is displayed in the patient view template

### Dynamic Fields Implementation
The dynamic fields implementation uses JavaScript to show/hide additional fields based on user selections:
- When a user selects "Yes" for Problematic Patient, the Problematic Patient Reason field appears
- When a user selects "Yes" for Loyalty Member, the Loyalty Member Number field appears
- When a user selects "Yes" for Chronic Condition, the Chronic Condition Details field appears
- When a user selects "Yes" for Allergy Alert, the Allergy Alert Details field appears

This approach improves the user experience by only showing relevant fields when needed, reducing clutter on the form.

### Data Storage
The implementation ensures that data for dynamic fields is only stored when their corresponding boolean fields are set to True:
- If Problematic Patient is "No", the Problematic Patient Reason field data is not stored
- If Loyalty Member is "No", the Loyalty Member Number field data is not stored
- If Chronic Condition is "No", the Chronic Condition Details field data is not stored
- If Allergy Alert is "No", the Allergy Alert Details field data is not stored

This approach ensures data integrity and reduces unnecessary storage of empty fields.

## Testing
The test plan includes comprehensive test cases for:
- Form creation and validation
- Form submission with various data combinations
- Dynamic field behavior
- Database integration
- Edge cases and error conditions
- MRN generation and uniqueness
- Race and ethnicity field validation
- Insurance information field validation
- Consent and privacy field validation

## Conclusion
The patient registration form has been successfully enhanced to include all required fields and improve the user experience. The implementation follows best practices for form design and data handling, ensuring both usability and data integrity. All Sprint 1 tasks have been completed, including the implementation of Medical Record Number auto-generation, Race and Ethnicity fields for public health reporting, Enhanced Insurance Information Collection, and Consent and Privacy Practice Tracking.
