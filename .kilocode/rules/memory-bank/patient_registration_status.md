## Overview
This document tracks the implementation status of the enhanced patient registration form, which includes additional fields and dynamic behavior to align with hospital guidelines.

- Database storage verification pending

## Next Steps
1. Complete the template implementation for the patient registration form
2. Test the updated patient registration form in the browser
3. Test the dynamic field behavior to ensure fields appear and disappear as expected
4. Test form submission to ensure all data is properly stored in the database
