## Detailed Gap Analysis

### High Priority Gaps (Regulatory/Compliance)
1. **Missing Medical Record Number (MRN)** - Critical for patient identification and regulatory compliance
2. **Missing Race & Ethnicity fields** - Required for public health reporting
3. **Incomplete Insurance Information** - Missing policy numbers, guarantor information
4. **Missing Consent and Privacy Practice tracking** - Required for HIPAA compliance

### Medium Priority Gaps (Clinical Safety)
1. **Incomplete Allergy Tracking** - Need specific allergy types rather than generic alert
2. **Missing Infectious Disease/Isolation Precautions** - Important for infection control
3. **Missing Physiological State Tracking** - Important for clinical decision-making
4. **Missing Implant Tracking** - Critical for medical procedures and safety

### Low Priority Gaps (Operational Enhancement)
1. **Missing Middle Name/Suffix** - Minor enhancement to patient identification
2. **Missing Detailed Contact Information** - Additional phone numbers, separate mailing address
3. **Missing Care Coordination Information** - PCP and referring physician details
4. **Missing Detailed Communication Preferences** - More specific communication tracking

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. Add Medical Record Number (MRN) field to patient model and forms
2. Add Race and Ethnicity fields to patient model and forms
3. Enhance insurance information collection (policy numbers, guarantor)
4. Implement consent and privacy practice acknowledgment tracking

### Short-term Improvements (Medium Priority)
1. Enhance allergy tracking with specific types
2. Add infectious disease and isolation precaution flags
3. Add physiological state and implant tracking
4. Improve contact information fields

### Long-term Enhancements (Low Priority)
1. Add middle name/suffix fields
2. Add detailed communication preferences
3. Add care coordination information
4. Enhance social/operational flags

## Implementation Status
- **Current Implementation**: Basic patient registration with limited fields
- **Documentation Alignment**: Significant gaps between documentation and implementation
- **Compliance Status**: Not fully compliant with documented requirements
